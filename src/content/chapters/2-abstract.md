THE ABSTRACT

The purpose of an abstract is to help readers to evaluate and select a document that they would find useful in their own research; it’s your two-minute trailer that tells the audience enough about the film so that they can decide, before entering the cinema, whether or not they want to commit two-to-three hours of their lives to it. An abstract should display the core components of the narrative of the report without requiring your audience to read the actual document. In the case of a lab report, the abstract should be informative. In the section below, the parts of an abstract are outlined, and examples are given of both good and bad abstracts to ground this information.
2.1  The Informative Abstract
An informative abstract is a single paragraph made up of four parts: purpose, methodology, results, and conclusions/implications of results (note that these mirror the four parts of the body of the report). Also note that while headings are used in this guide to explain what each part should contain, they should not be used in your actual abstract.
1.1.1  Purpose
This is the first sentence of the abstract, your first attention grab. As such, it is worth outlining why the topic under investigation is of interest, and state the primary objectives of the experiment. You might also include the hypotheses of the experiment, although your predictions are of less interest to a reader than your findings. So, if you were struggling with the word limit, it is better to omit hypotheses to allow for a more detailed description of your results. The purpose component would typically be no more than two to three sentences.
1.1.2  Methodology
 This section briefly describes the number of participants tested and the task used in the experiment. This section should give only as much detail as is necessary to understand the experiment; an abstract rarely focuses entirely on research methods (unless that is the primary focus of the original document). It’s much more likely that the purpose of the experiment is to answer a problem of interest rather than extend a component of methodology (particularly in undergrad!).
1.1.3  Results
This section relates the main findings of the experiment, and can include a report of the statistical test(s) used (i.e., the results of the tests, not simply “we used a t test”). This section should be concise and informative. 
1.1.4  Conclusion
An informative abstract ends with an evaluation or analysis of the results. This evaluation might end with the implications of these results (remember, you want your results to sound important so that people will read the paper!). While the conclusion may respond to whether the driving hypothesis of the experiment was supported, it should only do so if the hypothesis was included at the beginning the abstract. Note: A conclusion should not include limitations and future directions as these are not of primary interest to the reader. (And you want to show your research in a positive light! Don’t shoot yourself in the foot.)
1.2  Writing a good abstract
Because an abstract is a description of an entire document, you can only write an accurate abstract once that document is complete. Consequently (and somewhat counter-intuitively), the abstract will typically be the last section of the lab report that you will write. From an assessment stand-point, this section of the report is often not worth as many marks as the other sections, but it is the first section your marker will read (and hence, the first impression you make on your marker) so it is still worth doing well. 
These are the ABCs of abstract writing:
Accuracy: Only report information included in the original document.
Brevity: Get straight to the point in clear and concise language. 
Clarity: A good abstract does not contain jargon or colloquialisms and always explains any acronyms (Note: it is actually unlikely that you will need acronyms in an abstract, as acronyms are only valuable in the abstract if the terms are being used more than once in that section).
1.2.1  Common errors 
Students often put too much focus on the background and method, with only a cursory mention of the results. Remember that the reader is just as, if not more, interested in what you find, not just how you achieved that result or why you did the study. 
Choosing to end with limitations instead of implications (and/or leaving out the implications entirely) is another common error. Including a large list of limitations instead of implications is the researcher telling the reader that they shouldn’t even bother reading the paper because it’s not worth the time. An example of a poorly written abstract is something like this:

As (I hope) you can see, the above abstract is not actually informative (see what I did there?). The outline of the background was unnecessarily long, contained a tautology (“essential and crucial”), introduced an abbreviation that was never used again in the abstract (“VSTM”), and did not actually inform the reader about the goal of the study. The methodology section was also unnecessarily detailed in parts, and quite vague in others: Your audience is unlikely to be interested in the specific subject studied by the participants, but would definitely want to know more about the experimental design. For instance, was this a within subjects or a between groups design, and how was performance actually measured? The results section also told the reader absolutely nothing about what was found (with a p value that was imprecise and formatted incorrectly to boot! See section 5.2.1 for more on this), and a conclusion which casts doubt on the validity of the findings is sure to send any reader running back to their Google Scholar search results to find a different paper to read.
A better example of an abstract for the same study would be:

This abstract provides a much clearer summary of the report. It begins by immediately identifying the topic of interest and the problem the study aimed to address. This is followed by a brief description of the task and experimental design, and precise (and correctly formatted) report of the main findings. Finally, the implications of these findings are explained concisely in the last sentence. Interestingly, the hypotheses, and whether or not they were supported by the results, were not included and yet did not detract from the clarity of this abstract at all. 
TL; DR:  Abstract Dos and Don’ts
