# FOREWORD

Hello! In choosing to read this guide (including the foreword, no less), you have already demonstrated a commitment to learning and self-improvement. Good job! Give yourself a pat on the back; you’re doing well.

An essential skill for every scientist, psychologist or otherwise, is the ability to communicate research clearly and concisely. In order to develop this skill during your degree, you will complete a number of lab reports. As the focus of tutorials is not on lab reports, but content, the purpose of this guide is to provide you with a better understanding of how to write a lab report. It was written with students in mind, and offers numerous examples drawn from common student errors observed over several years of marking lab reports. I hope that reading this guide helps you avoid those mistakes.

Before we begin, two notes of caution: 1) This guide is meant to offer general advice on how to write a good lab report. If your tutor instructs you to do something contrary to what is in this guide, do as they say. Your tutor is the individual marking your lab report, and different subjects occasionally have different requirements. 2) Make sure you read the marking guide for each assignment before you commence writing to ensure you meet the expectations for that subject. 

This is quite a large document, but please don’t let this deter you from reading it! Each of the main headings in the table of contents is hyperlinked to the relevant page to help you navigate through it quickly. There are also a few “TL; DR”(too long; didn’t read) tables to provide you with a quick reference for the dos, don’ts, and common errors. I do strongly recommend that you read through the full document for maximum benefit, however. Links to additional sources (blue underlined text) are scattered throughout the document, should you require more information.

If you have any feedback about this guide or have spotted some corrections that should be made in future editions, please send them to sarah.moneer@unimelb.edu.au. Seriously, please do! I would love to know if you found this useful, and how I can make it better.
